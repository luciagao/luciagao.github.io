I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Department of Civil and Mineral Engineering, University of Toronto. My research interests include transport policy and travel behaviour, travel demand modelling, land use and transport interactions.

Prior to that, I obtained my Ph.D. from [Tongji University](https://www.tongji.edu.cn/) in Urban Planning. I am very fortunate to be supervised by [Prof. Haixiao Pan](https://upd-caup.tongji.edu.cn/16/70/c20527a202352/page.htm/) at Tongji University, and [Prof. Khandker Nurul Habib](https://www.khandkernurulhabib.com/copy-of-bio-1/) during my exchange period at the University of Toronto.
