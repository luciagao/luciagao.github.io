I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Department of Civil and Mineral Engineering, University of Toronto. My research interests include travel behaviour choices of people, travel demand modelling, land use and transportation interactions. 

Prior to that, I obtained my Ph.D. from Tongji University in Urban Planning. I am very fortunate to be supervised by [Prof. Haixiao Pan](https://upd-caup.tongji.edu.cn/16/70/c20527a202352/page.htm/) at Tongji University, and [Prof. Khandker Nurul Habib](https://www.khandkernurulhabib.com/) during my exchange period at the University of Toronto. My doctoral dissertation focuses on high-speed rail (HSR) and intercity travel demand, aiming to understand travel behaviour change and demand outcomes derived from HSR for business, leisure, and commuter travel purposes. I have experience in quantitative and qualitative survey design and data/information processing, and I have led three projects on understanding people's travel behaviour using mobile data. I am also the winner of the 2022 Best Paper Award of the International Workshop on High-Speed Rail Socioeconomic Impacts (awarded by the International Union of Railways).
