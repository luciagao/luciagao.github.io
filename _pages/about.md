I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Department of Civil and Mineral Engineering, University of Toronto. My research interest includes travel behaviour analysis, the interaction between land use and transport, and transport policy.

Prior to that, I obtained my Ph.D. from [Tongji University](https://www.tongji.edu.cn/) in [Urban Planning](https://caup.tongji.edu.cn/caupen/main.htm/). During my Ph.D., I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Haixiao Pan](https://upd-caup.tongji.edu.cn/16/70/c20527a202352/page.htm/) at Tongji University, and [Prof. Khandker Nurul Habib](https://www.khandkernurulhabib.com/copy-of-bio-1/) during my exchange period at the University of Toronto.
